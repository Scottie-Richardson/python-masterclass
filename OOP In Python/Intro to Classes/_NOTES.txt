This file contains the basics of OOP (object oriented programming) in Python.

It also serves as an introduction to documenting code in a more through way than
    simple comments using Python DocStrings which are contained within two sets
    of three double quotes for example:
            """ This is a DocString """

This portion of the section also begins touching on encaptualization, but it
    will be explored more throughly in the later patrs of this section.
